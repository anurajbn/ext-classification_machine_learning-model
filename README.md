The spam SMS and email classifier is a comprehensive test project aiming to distinguish spam from non-spam messages. The workflow includes data cleaning, EDA, and text preprocessing. Techniques such as lowercase conversion, tokenization, special character removal, stop word elimination, and stemming improve model performance.

The core involves model building with a Naive Bayes Multinomial (1NB) model using TF-IDF features for text representation. The model underwent iterative improvements based on evaluation outcomes to enhance accuracy.

Excitingly, the project transformed into a Streamlit web app for real-time interactive classification.

Success stems from a substantial dataset with 5000+ spam and non-spam messages, ensuring robustness and generalizability.

This project showcases an efficient text classification approach, combining data preparation, preprocessing, and model building, leading to a user-friendly web app for spam detection.
